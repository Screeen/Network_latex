\subsection*{Introduction}
When measurements are performed on a network, the resulting dataset can be analysed to quantify properties of the underlying network. In this assignment a dataset of face-to-face contact data of highschool students\footnote{R. Mastrandrea, J. Fournet, A. Barrat, Contact patterns in a high school: a comparison between data collected using wearable sensors, contact diaries and friendship surveys. PLoS ONE 10(9): e0136497 (2015)} is analysed.

This data not only includes contact information at a certain time, but also how contact changes over time; every measurement specifies which two students have had contact and at which time this occured. Students will be modeled as nodes in a graph and contact between students as edges. Each edge will also be labeled with the timestamp at which the contact it represents was made.

To begin with, this data will be aggregated over all time to analyse the topology of the resulting aggregated network. Secondly, the time of measurement will be taken into consideration. Several metrics will be used to analyse which nodes are most influential when information spreads across this temporal network. Lastly, temporal features of the network will be altered to inspect their influence on the information spreading process.

\subsection*{Part A: Topological features of the aggregated network}
\label{sec:partA}

All measured topological features are summarized in table \ref{tab:topological_features}.

The aggregated graph \(G\) is constructed by connecting any two nodes by an (unweighted) edge if the nodes make contact with eachother at least once in the \(T=7375\) timesteps available.

\(G\) has \(N=327\) nodes and \(L=5818\) links. The link density is computed as
\begin{align*}
p = \frac{E[L]}{L_{max}} = \frac{L}{N(N-1)/2} = 0.1092
\end{align*}

Several metrics inspect the degree of nodes in the network, of which an insightful one is the degree distribution (fig.~\ref{fig:degree_distribution}). It can be seen that this distribution resembles a Poisson distribution. This suggests that an Erdös-Renyi (ER) graph model would be well suited to model the face-to-face contact network. In contrast, a scale-free graph model would be a bad choice of model because scale-free graphs show a linear distribution when viewed on a log-log scale and this is absolutely not the case (fig.~\ref{fig:degree_distribution_loglog}).

The average and variance of the degree are \(E[D]=35.58\) and \(Var[D]=182.2\), respectively. The degree assortativity (\(\rho_D=0.03318\)) is defined as the (linear) correlation coefficient between the degrees of nodes, so a value of almost zero means the degrees of nodes are not correlated at all. This means that the creation of new links is not influenced by existing links; another argument for using the ER graph model, where edges are created with independent probabilities (and are therefore uncorrelated).

Furthermore, it is interesting to check whether the network exhibits the small-world property, i.e. nodes are not very clustered but can still reach other nodes in relatively few hops. Using the clustering coefficient (\(C=0.5035\)) and average hopcount (\(E[H]=2.159\)) normalized by that of the regular graph results in the following metrics: \todo{suspicious that they're larger than one...}
\begin{align*}
C/C(0) = 4.681\\
E[H]/E[H](0) = 1.132
\end{align*}
Because the (normalized) clustering coefficient is several times higher than the average hopcount, the network exhibits the small-world property. \todo{C\(>\)E[H] shows from the graph on the slides, but I thought the clustering had to be lower, not higher?!}

\todo{L proportional to log N for small-world networks (plot over time) better test for small-world property?}

Comparing the average hopcount (\(E[H]=2.159\)) with the diameter of the graph (\(H_{max}=4\)) we see that there is not a lot of variance in hopcounts of shortest paths between nodes; the diameter (the worst-case hopcount of shortest paths) is close to the graph's efficiency (the average hopcount). This again points to the small-world property.

Lastly, some spectral metrics of the aggregated graph are considered. The spectral radius is calculated as the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix \(\lambda_1=41.23\). The algebraic connectivity is the second smallest eigenvalue of not the adjacency but the Laplacian matrix, \(a=\mu_{N-1}=1.930\). \todo{is this a lot or not? perhaps compare with upper bound 1/nD where n is nodes in complete graph?}


\subsection*{Part B: Information spreading on a temporal network}
%9) Taking all the N iterations into count, plot the average number of infected nodes E[I(t)] together with
%its error bar (standard deviation pV ar[I(t)]) as a function of the time step t.

As mentioned in the introduction, each edge was labeled with the timestamp at which the contact between students it represents was made. This means we can simulate the spread of information over the network over time. The information spreading process used is as follows: an infected node can infect any nodes it is in contact with (i.e. its neighbours at a specific timestamp), but these neighbours can only start infecting other nodes at the next timestamp. Infection starts with some selected seed node. This simulation is done N times; every node is a seed node once. Graphs of the number of infected nodes \(I(t)\) will show the average \(E[I(t)]\) as well as the standard deviation \(\sqrt{Var[I(t)]}\) over these N simulations.

One metric used to quantify how fast information spreads over the temporal network is the timestamp at which 80\% of all nodes have been infected. For every simulation the seed node and timestamp of 80\% infection is recorded. By sorting the seed nodes by their 80\% infection timestamps, the nodes are ranked according to their influence as a seed node. Let's call this ranking \(R=[R_{(1)}, R_{(2)}, ..., R_{(N)}]\). This ordering can now be used as a standard to quantify nodes' influence. Using the same process nodes can be ranked using other metrics (e.g. the degree, \(D=[D_{(1)}, D_{(2)}, ..., D_{(N)}]\)) and subsequently compared with R by checking how many nodes are in the same top-f fraction for both metrics, R and D. This is called the top-f recognition rate and is calculated as:
\begin{align*}
	r_{RD}(f) = \frac{\left|R_f \cap D_f\right|}{\left|R_f\right|}
\end{align*}

Several metrics are compared to R using this procedure. The results can be found in figure \ref{fig:???}. \todo{figure and reference + conclusions from figure}

\end{figure}

%\tiny{10) How influential a node is as a seed node could be partially reflected by, e.g. the time it takes to
%reach/infect 80 of the total nodes when this node is selected as the seed node. The shorter the time is, the
%more influential the seed node is. Using this standard to rank the influence of all the nodes and record the
%ranking in a vector R , ri is the node index of the i − th most influential seed
%node and R is the most influential node that infects 80 nodes in the shortest time. Note that you don’t
%need to provide this vector in your report.
%11) We are going to explore which nodal level network feature could well suggest the nodal influence discussed
%in 10). Compute the degree and clustering coefficient of each node in the aggregated network G and rank the
%importance of the nodes according to these two centrality metrics respectively. You obtain the ordered vector
%D  is the node having the i − th highest degree
%and C is the node with the i − th highest clustering coefficient. How precise a centrality metric e.g. the
%degree could predict seed nodes’ influence could be quantified by the top f recognition rate rRD
%where Rf and Df are the sets of nodes ranking in the top f fraction according to their influence and degree
%respectively and jRfj = fN is the number of nodes in Rf . Plot rRD and rRCas a function of f where
%f = 0:05; 0:1; 0:15; :::; 0:5. Which metric, the degree or the clustering coefficient could better predict the influence
%of the nodes? Why?
%12) Propose another two nodal/centrality features that could possibly well predict nodes’ influence. The
%previous two features are all based on the aggregated network. At least one feature that you are going to
%propose should take nodal temporal features into account. Compare the two features you proposed and the two
%features proposed in question 11): which feature better/badly reflects how influential a node is and why? Hint:
%Similar to 11) plot rRM (f) as a function of f for each metric M you proposed.
%13) Reflection on B: What can be improved in the aforementioned analysis method to discover which nodal
%feature could better reflect how influential a node is as a seed node?}

The metrics based on the temporal features are more accurate in detecting the most influential seed nodes.}

\subsection*{Part C: Influence of temporal network features on information spreading}
% Construct the following three temporal networks. G2 is exactly the same as Gdata except that the time
%stamps describing when each temporal link (contact) appears in Gdata are randomlized in G2. In other words,
%G2 is constructed by copying all the temporal links from Gdata but their time stamps are randomly re-shuffled
%or equivalently, randomly reassigned to the temporal links. The number of contacts between each node pair is
%the same between Gdata and G2. [A time stamp vector v, whose length equals the number of contacts, can be
%randomly reshuffled to a vector v2 by assigning each element in v to a randomly selected position in vector v2
%while avoiding more than one elements from v assigned to the same position in v2].
%G3 is constructed by the following steps: G∗ 3 has the same topology as G, which is an unweighted network.
%Second, assign the time stamps in Gdata to the linked node pairs (links) in G∗ 3, randomly. A link in G∗ 3 may
%receive more than one time stamps, meaning that the two nodes contact more than once. A link G∗ 3 receives no
%time stamp means that there is no contact between the corresponding two nodes. G3 is composed of all these
%contacts.
%15) Simulate exactly the same information spreading process on G2 and G3 as described in B. On each
%temporal network, N iterations of the spreading processes are simulated and each iteration starts at a different
%seed node. Plot the average number of infected nodes E[I(t)] and the standard deviation pV ar[I(t)] as a
%function of the time step t for Gdata, G2 and G3 respectively. Compare and rank the information spreading
%performance (e.g. prevalence or speed of the spread) on these three temporal networks. Interpret/explain
%your observation. For example, which temporal network features could possibly explain the different spreading
%performance on these temporal networks?
